SteamOS Non-Steam Game Manager

Bring the full Steam experience to your non-Steam games on SteamOS.
This project transforms how non-Steam games appear and behave inside Steam â€” integrating achievements, rich metadata, events, and full native Steam UI presentation â€” as if they were real Steam games.

Features

Native Steam Integration: Non-Steam games are seamlessly injected into Steam with:

Full grid/capsule art and metadata

Steam-style achievements & rich presence

Events and update notifications

Controller layout support


Metadata Sync: Automatically fetches cover art, icons, description, genres, and more from online sources.

Event System: Adds custom update notes, patch logs, and notifications in the Steam library.

Launch Customization: Configure pre-launch scripts, launch parameters, and custom overlays.

Cross-platform Ready: Built for SteamOS, works in Game Mode with perfect controller support.


Motivation

SteamOS provides a beautiful, console-like experience â€” but non-Steam games are second-class citizens.
I built this program to close the gap. After deep reverse-engineering and system integration, this tool gives non-Steam games parity with official Steam titles.


Contributing

I built this from scratch with care and precision. Contributions, bug reports, and feature suggestions are welcome â€” but please respect the vision: non-Steam should feel native.
